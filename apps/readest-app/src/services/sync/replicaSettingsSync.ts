/**
 * Settings publish/apply orchestration. Sits between useSettingsStore
 * and the replica-sync pipeline so per-field LWW works on bundled
 * SystemSettings preferences.
 *
 * Push side: `publishSettingsIfChanged(settings)` runs after every
 * settingsStore save. It walks the whitelist, diffs against the
 * snapshot, and emits a single replica upsert with only the changed
 * fields. There are three tracking flavors:
 *   * Plain settings diff against an in-memory `lastPublishedFields`
 *     snapshot, seeded from disk at boot (see `initSettingsSync`).
 *   * Encrypted paths use a SHA-256 hash of the value as the snapshot
 *     (persisted in localStorage so refresh-after-credential-set doesn't
 *     re-fire the prompt). When the diff includes a new non-empty
 *     encrypted value AND the CryptoSession is locked, we proactively
 *     trigger the passphrase gate — the moment the user opts into
 *     encrypted-credential sync.
 *   * Credential connection metadata (`CONNECTION_PATHS`: serverUrl,
 *     endpoint, rootPath, ...) is plaintext but push-hash tracked like
 *     the encrypted fields rather than disk-seeded, so a URL configured
 *     before it was ever published still reaches the other devices
 *     alongside its credentials (#5141).
 *
 * Pull side: `applyRemoteSettings(record)` merges a remote partial
 * into useSettingsStore, persists, and updates both snapshots so the
 * post-save publish hook sees no diff and we don't echo the remote
 * update back at the server.
 *
 * Users who never use credential-bearing features (kosync, readwise,
 * hardcover, OPDS-with-creds) never see the passphrase prompt: every
 * encrypted path's snapshot is empty / matches "" so the diff doesn't
 * include them.
