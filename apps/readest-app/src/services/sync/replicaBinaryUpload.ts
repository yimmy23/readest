 *   - adapter.binary.localBaseDir for the upload base
 *
 * Resolves missing byteSize entries via openFile so progress reporting
 * is accurate. The TransferManager fires `replica-transfer-complete`

 * publishReplicaManifest call (binaries first, manifest last).
 *
 * No-op when:
 *   - the record lacks contentId (legacy / unsynced)
 *   - the kind isn't registered or has no binary capability
 *   - TransferManager isn't initialized yet (pre-library mount)
 *
 * Caller is responsible for ordering this AFTER publishReplicaUpsert
 * so the metadata row exists before the manifest commit fires.
