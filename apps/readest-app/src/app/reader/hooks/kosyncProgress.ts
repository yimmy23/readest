 * conflict detection (see {@link decideRemoteConflict}):
 *
 * - `resolved`     — the XPointer maps to a local position; `fraction` is an
 *                    apples-to-apples value comparable to Readest's progress.
 * - `unresolved`   — the progress IS a KOReader XPointer but couldn't be
 *                    converted to a local position (conversion threw, or the
 *                    CFI resolves to no local progress). This is common on iOS
 *                    (WKWebView) and is often a symptom of the DocFragment↔spine
 *                    drift (Bug A). It is NOT the same as "no conflict".
 * - `not-xpointer` — the server reported progress in a format Readest can't
 *                    resolve positionally (e.g. Kavita). The reported
 *                    percentage is the only comparable signal.
